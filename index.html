          <h2>Welcome to PR36</h2>
          <p>
            PR36 is not just another company backing startups. It's a movement,
            a revolution, a sanctuary for founders who dare to think beyond the
            ordinary. We're here to bulld the future-not just watch from the
            sidelines. We exist because we've seen brilliant founders crushed
            under outdated pressures, forced to pivot away from their vision,
            and ultimately losing the soul of what they set out to create.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            We say NO to that broken system. PR36 is a founder-first powerhouse,
            a collective of builders, and a launchpad for visionaries who want
            to create world-changing companies without compromise.

          <h2>What Makes PR36 Different?</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional accelerators or business hubs that prioritize
            rapid scaling over purpose, PR36 is a creator's haven built by
            founders, for founders. Here's how we break the mold

            <h3>üöÄ Not Just Support‚ÄîReal Experience</h3>

            <br />
            <p>
              Every person involved in PR36 has built something before. No
              outsiders dictating terms-only people who've been in the trenches
              and know what it takes. We bring expertise, networks, mentorship,
              and the kind of emotional and strategic support that only real
              founders understand.

            <br />
            <p>
              We don't back every "hot" startup. We handpick companies based on
              our collective passion and belief in their potential-not just
              their metrics. PR36 operates with a strict limit: only 36
              companies at any given time. This means deep Involvement, real
              commitment, and the full force of our network backing every
              business we choose

            <br />
            <p>
              Shark Tank and Dragons' Den kill ideas in minutes by fixating on
              numbers. We don't If the founder and idea are right, and there's a
              market fit somewhere in the world -now or in the future-we're in.
              Great ideas don't always look perfect on paper. We see beyond that
              and give founders the tools, guidance, and ecosystem they need to
              thrive.

            <br />
            <p>
              If a founder had everything figured out, they wouldn't need a
              partner. We acknowledge that no one is great at everything, and
              our job is to amplify strengths and bridge the gaps. We don't
              force businesses to conform to outdated molds-we help them become
              the best versions of themselves, without
